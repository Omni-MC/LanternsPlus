This mod aims to add many more lanterns to Minecraft that are themed around biomes, dimensions, etc.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These lanterns can be placed on the floor, hung from a ceiling, placed on the wall, and even placed underwater.

The mod currently contains 5 lanterns.

Recipes can be found with JEI or the in-game recipe book.

Please do feel free to suggest ideas for more themed lanterns. I'm hoping to add as many as I can, however my creativity is limited. 
So please, if you have ideas do not be afraid to share them in the comments.
