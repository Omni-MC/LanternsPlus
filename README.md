This mod aims to add many more lanterns to Minecraft that are themed around biomes, dimensions, etc.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These lanterns can be placed on the floor, hung from a ceiling, placed on the wall, and even placed underwater.

The mod currently contains four lanterns.

**-Prismarine Lantern**

       Crafted by surrounding a Prismarine Crystal in Prismarine Shards.
**-Purpur Lantern**

       Crafted by surrounding an End Rod in Popped Chorus Fruit.
**-Blazing Lantern**

       Crafted by surrounding a Blaze Rod in Nether Brick.
      
**-Red Mushroom Lantern**
       
       Crafted by surrounding a Glowstone block in Red Mushrooms.

**-Fancy Lantern**
      
       Obtained by placing a vanilla lantern in a the crafting grid alone.
 

Please do feel free to suggest ideas for more themed lanterns. I'm hoping to add as many as I can, however my creativity is limited. 
So please, if you have ideas do not be afraid to share them in the comments.
